# KEKOPS

This is the full source code for Kekops, a versatile Golang-based botting tool for the ROBLOX API. This tool is what powered the T0PK3K serverside
for nearly two years, and as a result of security patches by ROBLOX Kekops is now defunct. Because of this, I am now releasing the source code for the SS community to enjoy.
